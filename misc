This is not verified purchase review, have checked there is no order from the reviewer. And he/she can't provide the order id.

Yet in the review, it says "the recorder is nice, but I lost the manual and no online version is available. I can't figure out how to delete recordings or record over one", so that obviously it's fake review. Would you please help to remove this one star review? Thank you very much.
